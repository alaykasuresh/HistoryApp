Essentially, the history app that I have programmed is a creative, innovative and educational application that will allow users to learn more about historical figures and the ages at which they have passed. I have created this specific user interface as it is intuitive and user friendly. People of any age group would be able to understand the fundamental basics of this app. The background that I have used has been created especially to grasp the attention of its users it allows the user to envision and visualize themselves in that part of history thus in turn providing a more engaging experience for said user. It uses simple kotlin coding and the purpose of this application is to provide users with convenient information on historical figures, the aim is to deliver a user-friendly interface that allows us to enhance the user’s knowledge and interest in history by providing engaging content.
The user interface was designed to be visually appealing as it incorporates a clean layout with easy navigation options. There are various different elements used in the programming of this app. With every element used for the app, there has to be constraints allocated to ensure that they are situated in the correct places on the app for it to be properly visible And for your app to run smoothly. There is an edit text box that allows you to enter your specified age, a button underneath that allows you to generate the answer for your specified age as well as there is another button to clear that age which allows you to enter a different age for another output. Underneath your buttons is a black transparent box where your information about the historical figure will be displayed, I specifically used a black transparent box to show users where the information will be generated as well as it clearly shows the font and text which can help with visibility if users have Impaired vision. When designing my app I first drew up where I would want every aspect and element in a draft on paper to first see if I would be happy with the design layout that I have chosen, when I was happy with the layout I decided to implement them on the design using android studio. Before implementing them on Android studio I first had to do my research on different historical figures, it was not an easy task to choose which historical figures would be worthy enough for this designated app. I have chosen 15 historical figures that have made a great impact whether good or bad, in history. The age group I have chosen for these historical figures is between 20 to 100, anything out of this range will be presented as invalid.
There was a long thought process behind the development of the application. I first had to research the steps involved on how I would want the app to operate. A lot of research was done in order to find out the correct code to use for the app to run smoothly, many websites, YouTube videos as well as the prescribed module manual was used in order to do this. when implementing the different elements of the app I first had to declare every element. with declaring every element, I then have to figure out the purpose of each element such as for the buttons instead of choosing a switch or chip I chose a button as it would be easiest for the user to engage with. I also used the prescribed module manual on how I would give the button purpose. Following the steps that I have learnt, for both of the buttons used. I also had to figure out how I would use numerical values as well as the names of the historical figures.  at first it was difficult on how to start coding to for specific historical figures. Instead of using the basic IF & ELSE statement for each individual historical figure which would take quite some time to code or to copy and paste, I researched and found a better way to code although it still uses the if and else statement. I created a private val called famous people which then essentially bunched up all of the historical figures together and when coding later for these historical figures I used the val  In order to do this I also had to make sure my code recognized the age input first for the historical figure related to that age. This is where I created another val for the closest age input or for the closest match to the age that was input. Now with regards to the input of the age I needed to figure out a way to add in a line off code that would display the written words that shows that you are the same age as the historical figure. We previously learned in a lecture about a line of code called a toast. I implemented this code in the transparent black textbox to allow the users to see the displayed information on their historical figure. To display each written sentence whether it is for displaying information on the historical figure if it is invalid format or if it is invalid age range, I have used the code for the toast. Another one of the requirements was to enable a clear button so that users would be able to continuously input different ages for more historical figures. I added in the button and coding for the button was my last and final step. Through research on various websites I learned how to code a clear button which was fairly easy. Towards the end off my code I realized I had a few simple errors such as missing brackets incorrect use of var and Val as well as putting code on the wrong line. It was fairly easy to debug these errors and the application was able to run smoothly on the emulator I have chosen. I used an emulator with an API of 26 that ran on Android Oreo 8.0. There was no issues and everything fell within range. After I saw no errors and warnings with my code, I made use of GitHub to run my code to see if it would run with any issues. Once I was happy with my code I then had to chance per or push my code from Android studio to a repository on GitHub. This app is my second attempt on creating the history app as I have made sure it runs perfectly fine.
The aim of this app is to provide an enjoyable experience for users to learn about history. The kotlin history app that I have programmed serves as a valuable tool for learning and exploring history in a very convenient engaging manner. By incorporating thoughtful design considerations and following a very structured development process, I hope that users will foster a deeper appreciation for the subject as the app provides knowledge off historical information with more easier access to it. I am positive that this app will appeal to a diverse audience of learners and history enthusiasts who are willing to learn more about historical figures.
